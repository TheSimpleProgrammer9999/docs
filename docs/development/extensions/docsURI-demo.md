# Strings and Numbers

In this extension, you play around with blocks with strings and numbers. You can convert strings to upper case by using the "convert string [] to [uppercase, lowercase, anonymous(not in use)]"
-"uppercase" will converting the string to uppercase
-"lowercase" will converting the string to lowercase
-"anonymous(not in use)" will return nothing, since it is a placeholder for nothing.

the reporter block "generate random decimal" generates a random decimal, 0.06878974855646 for example.
the reporter block "pi" will return the mathematical constant, pi.
the reporter block "euler" will return the constant "e"(euler's number)
the block "print in console [TEXT]" is a block that will print "TEXT" to the console.
the reporter block "length of string [STRING]" is a block that returns the length of "STRING". iIf the value is an integer, it will return "undefined". so it can only return lengths of strings.
